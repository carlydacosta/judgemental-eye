Judgemental Eye: A Movie Rating App
===================================
My partner Erika Arnold and I built this movie ratings app as an exercise at Hackbright. It is an interface for a users to view movies they have rated, as well as movies rated by other users. 

For unrated movies, the Judgemental Eye predicts what the user's rating will be (based on Pearson correlations with other users who have rated that movie), and then it judges you, based on its "own" rating of the movie.
